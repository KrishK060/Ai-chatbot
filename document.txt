* Comprehensive Replies: Address all client questions or remarks in your responses; avoid selectively answering.
* Preparedness for Meetings: Always prepare for client meetings by having relevant links, demos, screenshots, or documents ready.

* Complete Conversations: Ensure discussions are concluded logically before logging off for the day.
Asking Questions
* Thoughtful Questions: Avoid repetitive or trivial questions. Provide context and assume reasonable interpretations to avoid unnecessary queries.
* Suggest Options: Present potential solutions or options when seeking guidance instead of asking open-ended questions.

Explanations
* Simplify for Non-Technical Clients: Avoid technical jargon when explaining issues to business-oriented clients. Focus on business implications.
* Detail for Technical Clients: Provide in-depth technical explanations for clients with a technical background.
* Report Changes: Inform clients about your availability, leaves, or timing changes, preferably after consulting your project/reporting manager for extended leaves.

* Admit Mistakes Gracefully: When a client points out a mistake, apologize rather than argue. If needed, provide a detailed explanation with supporting data.
* Elaborate Proposals: Compile detailed cases with supporting arguments for convincing clients on important decisions. Use emails or calls instead of fragmented chats.
General Etiquettes

   * Respond to greetings politely.
   * Use phrases like “Can you please…” or “I would appreciate if…” for requests.
